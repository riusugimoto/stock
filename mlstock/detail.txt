Loop Explanation
range(start, data.shape[0], step):
start: The index at which to start the loop. This defaults to 2500, meaning the backtesting will start with the 2500th data point.
data.shape[0]: The total number of rows in the dataset. This is the endpoint for the loop.
step: The size of each step in the loop. This defaults to 250, meaning the loop will increment by 250 rows at a time.\


Data Slicing
data.iloc[0:i].copy():

data.iloc[0:i]: Selects all rows from the beginning up to the ith row. This subset is used as the training data for the model.
.copy(): Creates a copy of the selected data to avoid altering the original dataset.
data.iloc[i:(i+step)].copy():

data.iloc[i:(i+step)]: Selects the rows from the ith index up to the (i+step)th index. This subset is used as the test data for the model.
.copy(): Creates a copy of the selected data to avoid altering the original dataset.

Hereâ€™s an illustration:
First iteration (i = 2500):
train: Rows 0 to 2499
test: Rows 2500 to 2749

Second iteration (i = 2750):
train: Rows 0 to 2749
test: Rows 2750 to 2999



pd.concat(all_predictions)
Purpose of Concatenation

Iteration 4:
all_predictions = [predictions_1, predictions_2, predictions_3, predictions_4]

Collect All Predictions: During each iteration of the loop, the model makes predictions for a specific test set.
 These predictions are stored in the all_predictions list. Each element in this list corresponds to the predictions made for one specific chunk of the data.

Combine Predictions: After the loop completes, the all_predictions list contains multiple DataFrames, each holding predictions for different segments of the data.
 Concatenating these DataFrames combines them into a single DataFrame, which represents the model's predictions for the entire dataset.

Evaluation and Analysis: Having all predictions in a single DataFrame allows for a more straightforward evaluation of the model's performance. 
You can easily compare the predicted values to the actual values, calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or any other performance measure, and visualize the results.
